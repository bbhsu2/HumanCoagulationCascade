#Human Coagulation Cascade
===================
###A multi-language implementation of the following paper:

**Wajima T, Isbister GK, Duffull SB.  A comprehensive model for the humoral coagulation network in humans.  Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Sep;86(3):290-8.**

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19516255

This model utilizes snake-bite data from another source to parametrize each of the coagulation (co)factors.   Runge-Kutta 2 is used to evaluate the ODE's.

A higher-level implementation (Matlab/Octave) exists here:
